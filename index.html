<p>My name is Hugo and this is my first website all about me!</p>
<p>To start off, I have an older sibling named Theo. He is sometimes nice to me and sometimes not.</p>
<p>I have 2 pet birds that are cockatiels and their names are 'Koala' and 'Blue'. They are VERY noisy at times (by that I mean all the time) but we still love them very much.</p>
<p>I rarely go outside in my own time, the only time you will find me outside is at school. I usually like to stay at home instead of going outside.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I really like playing video games, my favorites being Everhood, Risk of Rain 2 and Geometry Dash</p>
<p>If you have ever heard of or even played Undertale before and you like rhythm games, you will very much enjoy Everhood.<p>
<p>In Everhood, players control Red, a wooden puppet, on a quest to retrieve their stolen arm. The game is a rhythm-based adventure with RPG elements, featuring intense, colorful musical battles where Red must dodge attacks that are synced to the beat.</p>
<p>By the time I am writing this, Everhood 2 came out just 3 months ago but I recommend playing Everhood first to see if you like the game or not and get a grasp of the story.</p>
<p>Here's a link if you wanna buy Everhood</p>

<p>Risk Of Rain 2 is a rouge-lite game where you land on weird alien planets trying to find the teleporter back home.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing it because rouge-lite / rouge-likes are my favourite kind of video games and the graphics look reall cool.</p>
<p>Here's a link to buy Risk of Rain 2.</p>

<p>If you SOMEHOW don't already know what Geometry Dash is, it is a game where you play as a cube and you jump over spikes.</p>
<p>If you want a more detailed explanation, Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based action platformer where players navigate a square or other geometric shape through challenging, auto-scrolling levels filled with obstacles. The core gameplay involves jumping, flying, and flipping to avoid spikes and other hazards while keeping in sync with the level's music.</p>
<p>Here's a link to it so you can buy it!</p>

<p>I have a vr headset. If you don't know what that means, 'vr' stands for virtual reality, its pretty self-explanatory, a virtual reality!</p>
<p>And I play a bunch of games on it, here are my favorites!</p>
<img src="website images/beat saber.avif" alt="b saber" class="center">
<p>If you don't know what beat saber is, it is a game where you slice blocks in a specific direction with lightsabers to a good beat.</p>
<p>I know, it sounds like a fever dream, but it is very fun.</p>
<p>I especially recommend playing it with other people if you like competing. I always play it with my friend brownie (she didn't give me permission to say her real name).</p>
<hr/>
<p>I LOVE vr horror games, and I love Gorilla Tag movement and if you put those 2 together you get 'OG Fun Monke Horror'.</p>
<img src="website images/ogfmh.png" alt="ogfmh" class="center">
<p>OGFMH is a very fun and terrifying vr horror game that uses the Gorilla Tag movement. It has a bunch of maps that you can play, my favorites being Crawlspace and Dev Town.</p>
<p>Again, you HAVE to play this with other people unless you're that brave to go alone (I know I'm not) and I play this with my best friend brownie ALLTHE TIME.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, enough of video games and stuff, let's talk music!</p>
<p>My favourite music artist/rapper is 'Tyler, The Creator'</p>
<img src="website images/tyler.webp" alt="tyler" class="center">
<p>I like 'Tyler, The Creator' because of how unique his music is. It's really like nothing I have heard before.</p>
<p>Because honestly, I don't really find interest in other rappers music. It doesn't give me the same feeling as Tylers music does.</p>
<p>My favourite song is (I'm not gonna lie, out of all his songs their all my favorite) because whatever album the song you're listening to  is on, it gives you a different feeling depending on which album it is.</p>
<p>Like, take IGOR for example, his most popular album. It is about falling in love and then breaking apart. So the song you listen to on IGOR is either about not loving the person anymore or falling in love. (There is no in-between)</p>
<p>And he is the only rapper I enjoy listening too, to be honest.</p>
<p>Believe it or not I also play Roblox. Click down below for a link to my profile just incase you want to friend me! (pls donate, I have no robux)</p>
