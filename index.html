<h1>Hello People!</h1>
<p>My name is Hugo and this is my first website all about me!</p>
<p>To start off, I have an older sibling named Theo. He is sometimes nice to me and sometimes not.</p>
<p>I have 2 pet birds that are cockatiels and their names are 'Koala' and 'Blue'. They are VERY noisy at times (by that I mean all the time) but we still love them very much.</p>
<p>I rarely go outside in my own time, the only time you will find me outside is at school. I usually like to stay at home instead of going outside.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I really like playing video games, my favorites being Everhood and Risk of Rain 2.</p>
<p>If you have ever heard of or even played Undertale before and you like rhythm games, you will very much enjoy Everhood.<p>
<p>Everhood is a game where you ______. When you are in battle you have to jump over music notes to avoid losing lives.</p>
<p>By the time I am writing this, Everhood 2 came out just 3 months ago but I recommend playing Everhood first to see if you like the game or not and get a grasp of the story. Here's a link to steam if you wanna buy Everhood or Everhood 2.</p>

<p>Risk Of Rain 2 is a rouge-lite game where you land on weird alien planets trying to find the teleporter back home.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing it because rouge-lite / rouge-likes are my favourite kind of video games, and the graphics look very cool. Here's a link if you want to buy Risk of Rain 2 as well.</p>

<p>My favorite mobile game (if you're that interested) is 'Brawl Stars'</p>
<p>I like it because the developers of the game ALWAYS listen to the community, and make the game enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>They also add a bunch of fun content to their game often.</p>

<p>Now, enough of video games and stuff, let's talk music!</p>
<p>My favourite music artists are 'Tyler, The Creator' and 'Lil Tecca'</p>
<p>I like 'Tyler, The Creator' because of how unique his music is. It's really like nothing I have heard before.</p>
<p>Because honestly, I don't really find interest in other rappers music. It doesn't give me the same feeling as Tylers music does.</p>
<p>My favourite song is 'Heaven To Me' since it not only sounds ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY, he also talks about what heaven is to him (hence the name Heaven To Me) and how his childhood and how that was heaven to him</p>
<p>Lil Tecca literally sounds like a teenager but looks like he's in his mid-30s (he is). I am honestly just in love with his album 'PLAN A', every song on it is unskippable (except for 'I CAN'T LET GO' because Don Toliver sounds like he has a blocked nose) and the transitions in between the songs hit WAY TOO HARD.</p>
<p>Believe it or not I also play Roblox. Click down below for a link to my profile just incase you want to friend me! (pls donate, I have no robux)</p>
