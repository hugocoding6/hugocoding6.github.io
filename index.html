<div id="About Me" class="tabcontent">
    <img src="website images/penguin-hello.gif" alt="Hello" class="center">
    <p>My name is Hugo and this is my first website all about me!</p>
    <p>To start off, I have an older sibling named Theo. He is sometimes nice to me and sometimes not.</p>
    <p>I have 2 pet birds that are cockatiels and their names are 'Koala' and 'Blue'. They are VERY noisy at times (by that I mean all the time) but we still love them very much.</p>
    <p>I rarely go outside in my own time, the only time you will find me outside is at school. I usually like to stay at home instead of going outside.</p>

    <p>My favourite music artist is Tyler, The Creator.</p>
    <img src="website images/tyler the creator.jfif" alt="tyler" class="center">
    <p>I like 'Tyler, The Creator' because of how unique his music is. It's really like nothing I have heard before.</p>
    <p>Because honestly, I don't really find interest in other rappers music. It doesn't give me the same feeling as Tylers music does.</p>
    <p>My favourite song is, ALL OF HIS SONGS!. Yes, it may sound too good to be true but I love his music that much, but there are just a couple albums that I need to warn you about if you're gonna listen to him. PLEASE do not even touch the 2 albums Goblin or Bastard if you are sensitive, those 2 albums are not for the faint hearted at all. The beats are pretty good but the lyrics... I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
    <p>Speaking of albums, my favorite albums that I definetly recommend you listen to are Flower Boy and CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale.</p>
    <p>All the songs on those albums are unskippable, trust me.</p>

    <p>I really like playing video games, so let's talk about my favourites!</p>
<p>First up, Geometry Dash.</p>
<p>Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer game where players control a cube-shaped icon as it navigates through levels filled with obstacles and music.</p>
<p>The game emphasizes timing and reflexes, as players must jump, fly, and dodge obstacles to the beat of the music. It features a level editor for creating custom levels and playing those created by others.</p>
<p>Click the gif down below to be redirected to steam if you are on pc, except if you are on mobile just search 'Geometry Dash' on the app store or google play store to find it.</p>

<p>Now onto Roblox!</p>
<p>Roblox is an online platform where users can play and create games, essentially functioning as a massive multiplayer online game (MMO) and game creation system.</p>
<p>It allows anyone to design and share their own "experiences" (games) using the platform's tools and play games created by others.</p>
<p>Roblox also incorporates social features, allowing users to interact and create together. </p>
<p>Roblox is free and available on all platforms! So all you have to do to get it is search Roblox on pc, mobile or even console and you will be able to download it.</p>

<p>I have a vr headset. If you don't know what that is, vr stands for virtual reality, and I would like to share with you the friends I have made and the games I play.</p>
<img src="website images/beat saber.avif" alt="beats" class="center">
<p>Beat Saber is a virtual reality rhythm game where players slash blocks (beats) with lightsabers in time to music, while also dodging obstacles.</p>
<p>You can either play it singleplayer or multiplayer, I really enjoy playing it with my friend brownie. She also has a youtube channel so click the image down below and go subscribe!</p>

<p>I love horror games and the scarier the better so here is my favorite vr horror game!</p>
<img src="website images/ogfmh.png" alt="ogfmh" class="center">
<p>This is OG Fun Monke Horror, I know, it's a pretty unnecessarily long name but just ignore it.</p>
<p>The game is a horror experience where players navigate through various maps, facing monsters and restoring old versions of the "Fun Monke Horror" game. One popular map, "Run," features the Smiler monster, which is known for its speed and difficulty to outrun.</p>
<p>Unlike Beat Saber you pretty much HAVE to play this with other people unless you're just not afraid of anything but if you're a wuss like me, play this with other people and make some friends.</p>

<h1>KINGSAMMELOT</h1>
<p>He is VERY funny and would instantly make your day better just by watching one of his videos.</p>
<p>On his main channel he mainly plays Geometry Dash but on his live channel he live streams him doing/playing all sorts of stuff, my favorite being his subathons.</p>
<p>If you don't already know what a subathon is, it is when viewers can decide how long you will be streaming for by adding a custom amount of time each time they subscribe, gift a sub, cheer with bits or donate.</p>
<p>Here's the link to his main channel, KingSammelot.</p>
