<p>My name is Hugo and this is my first website all about me!</p>
<p>To start off, I have an older sibling named Theo. He is sometimes nice to me and sometimes not.</p>
<p>I have 2 pet birds that are cockatiels and their names are 'Koala' and 'Blue'. They are VERY noisy at times (by that I mean all the time) but we still love them very much.</p>
<p>I rarely go outside in my own time, the only time you will find me outside is at school. I usually like to stay at home instead of going outside.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I really like playing video games, my favorites being Everhood and Risk of Rain 2.</p>
<p>If you have ever heard of or even played Undertale before and you like rhythm games, you will very much enjoy Everhood.<p>
<p>Everhood is a surreal rhythm-adventure RPG where you play as Red, a wooden doll who must retrieve their stolen arm. The game features music-based battles where you dodge attacks that follow the rhythm.</p>
<p>By the time I am writing this, Everhood 2 came out just 3 months ago but I recommend playing Everhood first to see if you like the game or not and get a grasp of the story.</p>
<p>Here's a link to steam if you wanna buy Everhood.</p>

<p>Risk Of Rain 2 is a rouge-lite game where you land on weird alien planets trying to find the teleporter back home.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing it because rouge-lite / rouge-likes are my favourite kind of video games, and the graphics look very cool. Here's a link if you want to buy Risk of Rain 2 as well.</p>

<p>My favorite mobile games (if you're that interested) are 'Brawl Stars' and 'Geometry Dash'.</p>
<p>I like Brawl Stars because the developers of the game ALWAYS listen to the community, and make the game enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>They also add a bunch of fun content to their game often.</p>
<p>Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer where players control a geometric shape that automatically moves through levels, requiring precise timing and reflexes to navigate obstacles and synchronize with the music</p>
<p>Brawl Stars is free but Geometry Dash costs a bit so here's a link to buy Geometry Dash!</p>

<p>Now, enough of video games and stuff, let's talk music!</p>
<p>My favourite music artist is Tyler, The Creator.</p>
<img src="website images/tyler the creator.jfif" alt="tyler" class="center">
<p>I like 'Tyler, The Creator' because of how unique his music is. It's really like nothing I have heard before.</p>
<p>Because honestly, I don't really find interest in other rappers music. It doesn't give me the same feeling as Tylers music does.</p>
<p>My favourite song is, ALL OF HIS SONGS!. Yes, it may sound too good to be true but I love his music that much, but there are just a couple albums that I need to warn you about if you're gonna listen to him. PLEASE do not even touch the 2 albums Goblin or Bastard if you are sensitive, those 2 albums are not for the faint hearted at all. The beats are pretty good but the lyrics... I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of albums, my favorite albums that I definetly recommend you listen to are Flower Boy and Call Me If You Get Lost: The Estate Sale.</p>
<p>All the songs on those albums are unskippable, trust me.</p>
