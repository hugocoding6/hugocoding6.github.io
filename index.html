<p>My name is Hugo and this is my first website all about me!</p>
<p>To start off, I have an older sibling named Theo. He is sometimes nice to me and sometimes not.</p>
<p>I have 2 pet birds that are cockatiels and their names are 'Koala' and 'Blue'. They are VERY noisy at times (by that I mean all the time) but we still love them very much.</p>
<p>I rarely go outside in my own time, the only time you will find me outside is at school. I usually like to stay at home instead of going outside.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I really like playing video games, my favorites being Everhood and Risk of Rain 2.</p>
<p>If you have ever heard of or even played Undertale before and you like rhythm games, you will very much enjoy Everhood.<p>
<p>Everhood is a surreal rhythm-adventure RPG where you play as Red, a wooden doll who must retrieve their stolen arm. The game features music-based battles where you dodge attacks that follow the rhythm.</p>
<p>By the time I am writing this, Everhood 2 came out just 3 months ago but I recommend playing Everhood first to see if you like the game or not and get a grasp of the story.</p>
<p>Here's a link to steam if you wanna buy Everhood.</p>

<p>Risk Of Rain 2 is a rouge-lite game where you land on weird alien planets trying to find the teleporter back home.</p>
<p>I enjoy playing it because rouge-lite / rouge-likes are my favourite kind of video games, and the graphics look very cool. Here's a link if you want to buy Risk of Rain 2 as well.</p>

<p>My favorite mobile games are 'Brawl Stars' and 'Geometry Dash'.</p>
<p>I like Brawl Stars because the developers of the game ALWAYS listen to the community, and make the game enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>They also add a bunch of fun content to their game often.</p>
<p>Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based platformer where players control a geometric shape that automatically moves through levels, requiring precise timing and reflexes to navigate obstacles and synchronize with the music</p>
<p>Here's a link to buy Geometry Dash!</p>

<p>I have a vr headset. If you don't know what that is, vr stands for virtual reality, and I would like to share with you the friends I have made and the games I play.</p>
<img src="website images/beat saber.avif" alt="beats" class="center">
<p>Beat Saber is a virtual reality rhythm game where players slash blocks (beats) with lightsabers in time to music, while also dodging obstacles.</p>
<p>You can either play it singleplayer or multiplayer, I really enjoy playing it with my friend brownie. She also has a youtube channel so click the image down below and go subscribe!</p>

<p>I love horror games and the scarier the better so here is my favorite vr horror game!</p>
<img src="website images/ogfmh.png" alt="ogfmh" class="center">
<p>This is OG Fun Monke Horror, I know, it's a pretty unnecessarily long name but just ignore it.</p>
<p>The game is a horror experience where players navigate through various maps, facing monsters and restoring old versions of the "Fun Monke Horror" game. One popular map, "Run," features the Smiler monster, which is known for its speed and difficulty to outrun.</p>
<p>Unlike Beat Saber you pretty much HAVE to play this with other people unless you're just not afraid of anything but if you're a wuss like me, play this with other people and make some friends.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, enough of video games and stuff, let's talk music!</p>
<p>My favourite music artist is Tyler, The Creator.</p>
<img src="website images/tyler the creator.jfif" alt="tyler" class="center">
<p>I like 'Tyler, The Creator' because of how unique his music is. It's really like nothing I have heard before.</p>
<p>Because honestly, I don't really find interest in other rappers music. It doesn't give me the same feeling as Tylers music does.</p>
<p>My favourite song is, ALL OF HIS SONGS!. Yes, it may sound too good to be true but I love his music that much, but there are just a couple albums that I need to warn you about if you're gonna listen to him. PLEASE do not even touch the 2 albums Goblin or Bastard if you are sensitive, those 2 albums are not for the faint hearted at all. The beats are pretty good but the lyrics... I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of albums, my favorite albums that I definetly recommend you listen to are Flower Boy and CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale.</p>
<p>All the songs on those albums are unskippable, trust me.</p>

<p>Now for my 3 favorite youtubers!</p>
<h1>KINGSAMMELOT</h1>
<p>He is VERY funny and would instantly make your day better just by watching one of his videos.</p>
<p>On his main channel he mainly plays Geometry Dash but on his live channel he live streams him doing/playing all sorts of stuff, my favorite being his subathons.</p>
<p>If you don't already know what a subathon is, it is when viewers can decide how long you will be streaming for by adding a custom amount of time each time they subscribe, gift a sub, cheer with bits or donate.</p>
<p>Here's the link to his main channel, KingSammelot.</p>
